Price Estimator
=====================

We want you to make a price estimator that can take a subsection of the quote input columns, and 
provide a guess at the LOWEST price that would be offered by the panel of insurers for that set of 
quote circumstances. (to be clear - we are trying to guess the lowest price offered for a given 
QuoteID, regardless of insurer or payment method/type).

The choice of input variables is part of the task - you will find that some have a larger effect on 
prices than others (and some not at all, or they are simply fixed for this dataset). The goal here is to 
manage the complexity of your approach Vs the accuracy of a final model.
