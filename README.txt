Price Estimator
=====================

We want you to make a price estimator that can take a subsection of the quote input columns, and 
provide a guess at the LOWEST price that would be offered by the panel of insurers for that set of 
quote circumstances. (to be clear - we are trying to guess the lowest price offered for a given 
QuoteID, regardless of insurer or payment method/type).The goal here is to 
manage the complexity of your approach Vs the accuracy of a final model.
